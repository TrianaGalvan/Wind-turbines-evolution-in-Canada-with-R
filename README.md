## Analysis of wind turbines evolution over the last ten years in Canada using ggplot. 

In this project I explore wind turbines locations in Canada provinces/territories using different visualizations like a choropleth map, a ridgeline plot and histograms. In this repository I include the R markdown file, the data I used to draw the map and the results in two formats (HTML, PDF).
